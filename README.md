# SKYNOTE: A 3D Weather Visualization App

Welcome to SKYNOTE, a modern weather application that brings forecasts to life with interactive 3D visualizations. Built with Next.js, Genkit, and Three.js, this project demonstrates how to create a rich, data-driven user experience.

## SKYNOTE: A Comprehensive Project Breakdown

SKYNOTE is a modern weather application designed to deliver a visually immersive and data-rich experience. Its UI is built on a foundation of clarity, aesthetic appeal, and responsiveness, ensuring it is both beautiful and functional across all devices.

---

### **1. Core UI/UX Philosophy**

The design language of SKYNOTE is centered around **"glassmorphism,"** creating a sense of depth and modernity. UI elements are rendered as semi-transparent, blurred panels that float above a dynamic, animated background. This creates a clean, uncluttered interface where the weather information is the star.

*   **Responsiveness**: The layout is fully responsive, transforming from a multi-column dashboard on desktops to a single, scrollable feed on mobile devices.
*   **Hierarchy**: Information is organized logically. The most critical, at-a-glance weather data is presented first, followed by more detailed, secondary information.
*   **Interactivity**: Key components are interactive, from the horizontally-scrolling hourly forecast to the live-updating 3D background, inviting user engagement.

### **2. The Dynamic 3D Background (`WeatherVisualization.tsx`)**

This is the most defining feature of the UI. Built with **Three.js**, it's a full-screen 3D scene that renders a different animation for each weather condition:

*   **Technology**: `three`, `three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls`, `three/examples/jsm/objects/Lensflare`.
*   **Sunny**: Renders a glowing sun sphere with a `PointLight` and a `Lensflare` effect that creates realistic sun rays. The sun gently pulsates.
*   **Cloudy/Fog/Haze**: Procedurally generates multiple groups of `THREE.Group` objects, each containing several `IcosahedronGeometry` meshes to form soft, volumetric clouds that drift and rotate. Fog and Haze have a higher density of these clouds and a different color palette.
*   **Rainy/Snowy**: Uses a `THREE.Points` object (a particle system) to simulate thousands of falling raindrops or snowflakes. The particles are animated to fall downwards and recycle. The snow scene also includes cloud layers.
*   **Thunderstorm**: Features dark, emissive cloud meshes and a `PointLight` that flashes intermittently at random positions and intensities to simulate lightning.

### **3. Component-by-Component UI Breakdown**

The dashboard is a composite of several distinct, reusable React components.

*   **`WeatherDashboard.tsx` (The Conductor)**
    *   **Role**: The main component that orchestrates the entire application.
    *   **State Management**: Uses `useState` and `useTransition` hooks to manage `currentWeather` data, `weatherNarrative`, loading states (`isSearching`, `isGeneratingNarrative`), and geolocation status.
    *   **Data Fetching**: Initiates calls to the Genkit flows (`getWeatherData`, `getWeatherNarrative`) and handles success and error states using `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.
    *   **Layout Logic**: Contains the responsive grid (`grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-5`) that arranges all the card components, adapting the layout for desktop and mobile screens.

*   **`LocationSelector.tsx` (The Entry Point)**
    *   **UI**: Comprises a ShadCN `Input` field and a `Button` with a `Search` icon. A `Loader2` icon appears during searches.
    *   **Functionality**: This is where the user interacts. As the user types, it debounces the input and calls the `getLocationSuggestions` Genkit flow.
    *   **Dynamic Suggestions**: The results from the Geocoding API are displayed in a dropdown `Card`, allowing the user to select a precise location.

*   **`CurrentWeather.tsx` (The Main Display)**
    *   **UI**: The primary information card. It uses a combination of large, bold fonts for the temperature and smaller, lighter fonts for the location and date to create a clear visual hierarchy.
    *   **Layout**: A flexbox layout places the numeric data and condition on the left and a large `WeatherIcon` on the right. Below this is an inset panel with a distinct background that neatly contains the secondary metrics: "Feels Like," "Humidity," and "Wind Speed," each paired with a `lucide-react` icon (`Thermometer`, `Droplets`, `Wind`).

*   **`WeatherNarrative.tsx` (The AI Element)**
    *   **UI**: A simple card headed by a `Sparkles` icon and the title "AI Summary."
    *   **Functionality**: Displays the text generated by the `getWeatherNarrative` Genkit flow. It shows a `Skeleton` loader while the narrative is being generated. A `RefreshCw` button allows the user to request a new summary.

*   **`InteractiveHourlyForecast.tsx` (Short-Term Details)**
    *   **UI**: A horizontally scrolling container (`overflow-x-auto`) that never overflows the parent. Each item in the strip represents a 3-hour forecast, showing the time, `WeatherIcon`, temperature, wind, and humidity.
    *   **Styling**: A custom `no-scrollbar` utility class is used to hide the scrollbar for a cleaner look.

*   **`SunriseSunset.tsx` (Daily Milestones)**
    *   **UI**: A beautifully simple card displaying sunrise and sunset times, each accompanied by its respective `Sunrise` and `Sunset` icon from `lucide-react`. A gradient bar visually represents the transition of daylight.

*   **`DailyTemperatureTrend.tsx` (Visualized Week)**
    *   **UI**: A responsive line chart powered by **Recharts** (`recharts`). It plots two lines: one for the high (`tempHigh`) and one for the low (`tempLow`) temperatures for the next 7 days.
    *   **Customization**: Uses the custom `ChartContainer` and `ChartTooltipContent` from ShadCN charts to ensure the chart is themed correctly and tooltips are styled consistently.

*   **`WeatherForecast.tsx` (Detailed Week)**
    *   **UI**: A vertically-scrolling list of the 7-day forecast. Each row displays the day, a `WeatherIcon`, humidity, and a unique temperature range slider.
    *   **Temp Range Slider**: This custom element is not a real slider but a `div` styled to look like a track, with a colored bar inside representing the temperature range from low to high for that day. It provides an intuitive visual comparison of daily temperature fluctuations.

### **4. Tech Stack & Libraries (The "Things That Have Gone Into This Project")**

*   **Framework**: **Next.js 15** with the App Router.
*   **Language**: **TypeScript**.
*   **AI Backend**: **Genkit (v1.x)** with the `@genkit-ai/googleai` plugin, using the **Gemini** model for narrative generation.
*   **3D Graphics**: **Three.js**.
*   **UI Components**: **ShadCN UI**, a collection of accessible and composable components built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling, with custom themes and animations defined in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`.
*   **Icons**: **Lucide React** for crisp, lightweight SVG icons.
*   **Charts**: **Recharts** for creating the temperature trend chart.
*   **Utilities**: `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` (via `cn` utility) for intelligent class name handling. `date-fns` for robust date formatting.
