# SKYNOTE: A 3D Weather Visualization App

Welcome to SKYNOTE, a modern weather application that brings forecasts to life with interactive 3D visualizations. Built with Next.js, Genkit, and Three.js, this project demonstrates how to create a rich, data-driven user experience.

## Features

-   **Live Weather Data**: Get real-time weather conditions for any city in the world, powered by the OpenWeatherMap API.
-   **Dynamic 3D Visualizations**: The background dynamically changes to a beautiful and interactive 3D scene that reflects the current weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy). These visualizations are built with Three.js.
-   **AI-Powered Summaries**: Utilizes Genkit and Google's Gemini model to generate friendly, conversational weather narratives.
-   **Detailed Forecasts**:
    -   Current weather conditions, including temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
    -   7-day forecast with temperature ranges.
    -   Interactive hourly forecast for the next 24 hours.
    -   Sunrise and sunset times.
-   **Dynamic Location Search**: The search bar provides real-time location suggestions as you type, using the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API.
